# Adapting [Bitwig MCP Server](https://github.com/WeModulate/bitwig-mcp-server#readme) to MAGIX Vegas

## Overview

This guide explains how to provide similar remote-control and automation features in MAGIX Vegas as those offered by the [Bitwig MCP Server](https://github.com/WeModulate/bitwig-mcp-server#readme), by leveraging Vegasâ€™s scripting API.

## Mapping Core Features

| Bitwig MCP Feature              | Vegas Equivalent (via Scripting)          |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Play/Stop/Record                | Transport control                         |
| Set tempo/time signature        | Partial (Tempo via Vegas project)         |
| Track info/creation/deletion    | Track enumeration, add/remove via API     |
| Device parameters (FX)          | Access and automate Track FX              |
| Automation                     | Envelope (automation) control             |
| Export audio                    | Render project via scripting              |
| Preset recall                   | Load FX chains or presets via script      |

## Example: C# Script for Vegas

Place `.cs` scripts in the Vegas "Script Menu" folder. Run them from the Vegas "Tools > Scripting" menu.

## External Control

For remote control, use a local server (e.g., Python or Node.js) to listen for OSC/MIDI/MCP and invoke the Vegas script via command line or inter-process communication.

## Files

- `BitwigMCPAdapter.cs`: Vegas script implementing DAW control methods.
- `osc_bridge.py` (optional): Python script acting as a bridge between MCP/OSC and the Vegas script.
